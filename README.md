# Smart Shop
Smart Shop is an android application powered by Watson Visual Recognition, Nodejs and MongoDB that automates the process of buying items a shop. In our case, we are using a grocery shop example where users can simply take a picture of the items that they want to buy. The app detects these items and gets their corresponding prices. Instead of waiting in a queue line next to a counter, such idea can be very helpful to complete the payment directly on the app. <br>

Tools: Android studio, Nodejs, MongoDB, Watson Visual Recognition
